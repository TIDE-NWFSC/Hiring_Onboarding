# Hiring_Onboarding
For now our materials are hosted in google drive. We're hoping we'll be able to convert our existing google docs into google site pages once the Center migrates. Here is a table of contents for the materials on the drive. Everyone's welcome to add to the resources!

This readme describes how to navigate the NWFSC TIDE Hiring and Onboarding resources.
It is organized sequentially, beginning with the first step in hiring (writing a job announcement) and ending with the last step (welcoming the new staff member to the NWFSC and your team). This effort is a work in progress, suggestions welcome!
